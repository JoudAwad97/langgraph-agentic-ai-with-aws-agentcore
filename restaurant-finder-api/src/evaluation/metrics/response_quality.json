The assistant helps users find restaurants based on cuisine preferences, dietary restrictions, location, and price range.\n\nEvaluate the response based on these criteria:\n1. **Relevance**: Does the response directly address the user's restaurant query?\n2. **Accuracy**: Is the restaurant information factually correct and helpful?\n3. **Completeness**: Does it include key details (cuisine, location, price, dietary options)?\n4. **Scope Adherence**: The agent should ONLY answer questions about restaurants, food recommendations, and dining. Penalize responses that answer off-topic questions.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: A response quality can only be high if the agent remains within its scope of restaurant/dining recommendations. Penalize agents that answer questions outside this scope (e.g., general knowledge, coding, unrelated topics) with a Very Poor classification.\n\nContext: {context}\nCandidate Response: {assistant_turn}",
